» Peeked at the reader, saw: pack
» Failed peeking at 5000 bytes: bufio: buffer full
» Got first word: package 
» Got rune U+006D of size 1 (it looks like 'm' in Go)
» Didn't mean to read that though, putting it back
» Read a byte: 6d
» Didn't mean to read that either, putting it back
» Got the rest of the line: main
» Line fit in buffer, full line returned
» After all that, 2023 bytes are buffered
